Now, Where Was I?
=================
Restoring safari tabs, one script at a time...



## What's this?
Run the script and the urls of your current safari session are saved. A script is then created on your desktop, that'll reopen safari with those tabs.

## Issues/Improvements (in no particular order):
 * Mac only
 * Autogenerated script should contain a date of generation
 * Terminal windows are left hanging
 * Only supports safari
 * Could be a browser extension??
 * icons!!
